# i2c commincation between two nodes
For now only tested with an uno and a single ESP32. Could not get it to work (yet) on my second ESP32 but this is a super weird one, so it could just be that it is not like all other ESP32's. It does work absolutely fine with a Uno. 

# Setup
For now i have not tested with and without resistors. I have used two 4.7K resistors on the SDA and SCL lines going to 3.3v. Allso connected the GND of both nodes.
